If you are curious about the project, click here. Since then, I have been working on several projects in the health tech space, some examples being: Developing a platform to notify caregivers for epilepsia patients when they are about to have a seizure Building a platform for early respiratory disease detection, for the case of COVID-19, in partnership with the University of Stanford, US department of Health and UK National Health System Working on Remote Patient Monitoring solutions, for both Clinical Trials and Research purposes Want to know more?
