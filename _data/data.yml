  title: About Me
  summary: |

    Experience on building solutions for both web and mobile platforms (Android, iOS and hybrid) using Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I am enthusiastic about learning new things and sharing the knowledge with the people around me. My goal is to always create well written, readable and tested code.  I also enjoy contributing to open source (you can check it <a href="https://github.com/rodrigobressan" target="_blank">here</a>) and writing on my personal blog.

    Feel free to reach me if you have any available opportunities, I am sure that we could collaborate together.
