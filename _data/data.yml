  title: About Me
  summary: |

    Hey there,

     My name is Rodrigo, and I currently work as a Software Developer and Data Science researcher at Federal Institute of São Paulo. My major interests are related
     to Software Engineering and Development, but I am also interested on Data Science and Visualization. My current duties at Federal Institute of São Paulo are related to
     building solutions in the areas of decision making policies in healthcare by using Machine Learning techniques. I also do work with Biometrics and Deep Learning on my spare time.

     My current tech stack is composed mostly of data science tools, being mostly Python, Scikit-Learn, Keras and Plotting libraries (plotly, d3js, matplot), but I do also
     work heavily on software development with Django and Flask. When needed, I also support my team with some DevOps role, mostly by building Continuous Integration and
     Deployment pipelines (with Jenkins and Docker).

     In the past I have worked with other technologies, such as mobile development (Android, iOS and React Native), as well as integrating embedded devices with Biometric solutions, such as
     Presentation Attack Detection (Anti-Spoofing) and Gait Analysis.

     I am always trying to learn new things, and I do believe that the best way to (effectively) learn something is by teaching others about it. This can be intended as the major
     purpose of this blog.

     My major focus when working is to build reliable solutions, with major focus on testability, flexibility and ease to understand. If you share the same philosophy as me, feel free to call me for a quick chat.
