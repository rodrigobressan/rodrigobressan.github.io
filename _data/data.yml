  title: About Me
  summary: |
    I am a Full Stack Engineer, with over 9 years of professional experience on extensively building <b>reliable, robust and fault-tolerant systems</b>. In the past 3 years, I have been working on <b>mission critical systems (over 99% of uptime) on the field of biomedics and healthcare</b>.

    My skills cover the full spectrum of the cloud development, from the following areas:
    - <b>Front-end</b>: <i>React, Angular and Vue frameworks. Extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS/Typescript</i>
    - <b>Backend</b>: <i>Go, Python (Django), Java (Spring), NodeJS and Databases (SQL and NoSQL)</i>
    - <b>Infrastructure</b>: <i>AWS, IaC (Terraform), CI/CD, Kubernetes, Argo Workflows</i>
    - <b>ETL and Data Processing</b>: <i>AWS (Serverless, Glue, Lambdas, S3, Firehose), NumPy and Pandas</i>
    
    
    I have experience on <b>coordinating efforts between technical and non-technical people</b>, while also being able to understand and balance out product needs with technical requirements.

    Furthermore, I am <b>highly enthusiastic about learning new technologies and exploring new ways to solve problems</b> - but I for sure know that we should avoid reinventing the wheel, when possible.

    My work is always focused on building <b>highly testable code</b>, to which I believe brings not only an additional layer of security against bugs/defects, but also brings confidence to the team I am working with.

    On my spare time, I write on my personal blog and Medium, and I have a few active Open Source projects, which you can see on my <a href="github.com/rodrigobressan">Github</a>
