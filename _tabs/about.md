## A bit about work
I have been working with software engineering since 2015, and in the past 7 years, I have been focusing on building health tech products. My interest in healthcare grew when I started working in a project sponsored by the <b>[Bill and Mellinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/){:target="_blank"}</b>, where I had the opportunity to work on the development of a platform to identify and track the main factors behind child mortality. If you are curious about the project, click [here](/projects/#research--publications).

Since then, I have been working on several projects in the health tech space, some examples being:

- Developing a platform to <b>notify caregivers for epilepsia patients</b> when they are about to have a seizure
- Building a platform for <b>early respiratory disease detection</b>, for the case of COVID-19, in partnership with the <b>[University of Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}</b>, <b>[US department of Health](https://www.hhs.gov/){:target="_blank"}</b> and <b>[UK National Health System](https://www.nhs.uk/){:target="_blank"}</b>
- Working on <b>Remote Patient Monitoring</b> solutions, for both <b>Clinical Trials</b> and <b>Research purposes</b>

<b>If you are interested only on my work, click [here](#work) to jump to it - otherwise, keep reading!</b>

I'm Rodrigo Bressan, born and raised in Brazil - I have lived in several countries in the past years, and right now, I am based in Poland. On my free time, I am usually:

- Doing outdoor activities: rock climbing/bouldering, cycling, running
- Learning new languages (currently Polish! ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±)
- Fixing something broken on my VW T4 Campervan (last thing was the bush replacement on the gear selector system)

And when I am not doing any of the above, I am probably working on some [side projects](/projects)
