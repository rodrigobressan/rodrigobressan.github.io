# Work

I have been working with software engineering since 2015, and in the past 4 years, I have been focusing on building health tech products. My interest in healthcare grew when I started working in a project sponsored by the <b>[Bill and Mellinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/){:target="_blank"}</b>, where I had the opportunity to work on the development of a platform to identify and track the main factors behind child mortality. If you are curious about the project, click [here].

Since then, I have been working on several projects in the health tech space, some examples being:

- Developing a platform to <b>notify caregivers for epilepsia patients</b> when they are about to have a seizure
- Building a platform for <b>early respiratory disease detection</b>, for the case of COVID-19, in partnership with the <b>[University of Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}</b>, <b>[US department of Health](https://www.hhs.gov/){:target="_blank"}</b> and <b>[UK National Health System](https://www.nhs.uk/){:target="_blank"}</b>
- Working on <b>Remote Patient Monitoring</b> solutions, for both <b>Clinical Trials</b> and <b>Research purposes</b>

Over the past years, I have been working on a wide range of areas, such as:

- Cloud: AWS, Google Cloud
- Data Processing: Anonymization, Record Linkage, AWS Glue, Athena, Redshift, S3, Python
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, ArgoCD
- Backend: Go, Python and Java
- Frontend: React, Vue
- Regulatory: HIPAA, GDPR, ISO 27001
- Machine Learning: Keras, TensorFlow
