  title: About Me
  summary: |
    Hello, I'm Rodrigo Bressan, a Senior Software Engineer with a strong focus on building high-quality systems. Throughout my career, I have prioritized delivering top-notch solutions by emphasizing meticulous system design, coding practices, and testing methodologies. I firmly believe that quality is the foundation of successful software development.

    My skills cover the full spectrum of the Cloud development:

    - <b>Backend</b>: Go, Python (Django), Java (Spring) and Databases (SQL and NoSQL)
    - <b>Front-end</b>: React and Angular
    - <b>Infrastructure</b>: AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Argo CI/CD
    - <b>ETL and Data Processing</b>: AWS (Glue, Lambdas, S3, Firehose), NumPy and Pandas

    Lately, I have also been focusing on mentoring people around me. I take great joy in guiding and empowering junior engineers, helping them grow both technically and professionally. By fostering a supportive environment and advocating for best practices, I enable individuals to reach their full potential. Communication and empathy are key aspects of my mentoring approach, allowing me to connect with team members and provide the guidance they need.

    If you are interested in a collaboration, feel free to drop me a message - I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate
